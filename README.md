# Hi, I’m Mark 

I’m a Master’s student in Computer Science at Stanford (Computer & Network Security track), with a B.S. in CS (Systems track).  
I’m passionate about building **systems and security software** — projects that sit closer to the metal and form the backbone of modern computing.

### What I’ve Built
- **Heap Allocator** → malloc/free implementation in C with implicit & explicit free lists  
- **Virtual Memory Pager** → demand paging with the clock algorithm in C++  
- **TCP/IP Stack & Router** → ARP, IP routing, TCP sender/receiver, and TAP/TUN integration in C/C++  
- **COOL Compiler** → lexical analysis, parsing, type checking, and MIPS code generation in C/C++  
- **TRACY Debugger** → GDB extension with real-time stack visualization (Python, React, Flask)

### What I Work On Now
- **CurryVision** → a C++/OpenCV project for basketball shot tracking and trajectory analysis  
- **Cloud Infrastructure** → building and deploying AI pipelines with Docker, Kubernetes, and Google Cloud
