# Hi, I’m Mark 

I’m a Master’s student in Computer Science at Stanford (Computer & Network Security track), with a B.S. in CS (Systems track).  
I've found the most fulfilling work challenges to be motivated by my small-business drive, often at the intersection of software design, system implementation, and collaborative execution.

- **Virtual Memory Pager** → demand paging with the clock algorithm in C++  
- **TCP/IP Stack & Router** → ARP, IP routing, TCP sender/receiver, and TAP/TUN integration in C/C++  
- **COOL Compiler** → lexical analysis, parsing, type checking, and MIPS code generation in C/C++  
- **TRACY Debugger** → GDB extension with real-time stack visualization (Python, React, Flask)
